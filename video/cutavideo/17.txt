#### (2) Douyin Interaction Patterns (2 Hours)

  - **Liking**: Triggered by instant appeal (e.g., humor, aesthetics). Videos with strong 3-second hooks achieve 5-10% like rates.
  - **Commenting**: Driven by emotional resonance or prompts (e.g., “What’s your favorite?”). Comments spike in challenge or question-driven videos.
  - **Sharing/Forwarding**: High for relatable, surprising, or viral content (e.g., #Challenge videos). Shares increase when videos spark social conversation.
  - **Collecting/Saving**: Common for tutorials or inspirational content (e.g., cooking, fitness tips).
  - **Following**: Driven by consistent, high-quality content or creator relatability. Accounts posting 1-2 videos daily see 20% higher follow rates.
- **Behavioral Insights**:
  - **Attention Span**: 80% of users decide to skip within 3 seconds if not engaged.
  - **Peak Engagement**: First 10 seconds; drop-off occurs if no clear payoff (e.g., punchline, key message).

  - **Platform-Specific**: Douyin users favor fast-paced, visually dynamic content (e.g., quick cuts, AR effects).
- **Teaching Activity**:
  - Students watch 3 Douyin videos (e.g., a challenge, a tutorial, a brand ad) and map interaction patterns (likes vs. comments vs. shares).

#### (3) Strategies to Drive Interaction (1-2 Hours)
- **Content Design for Engagement**:
  - **3-Second Hook**: Start with a question, bold visual, or trending sound (e.g., “Can you guess this?”).
    - Example: A coffee brand video opens with “Best morning hack?” and shows a quick latte art clip.
  - **Emotional Triggers**: Humor, surprise, or nostalgia drive likes and shares (e.g., a funny pet video).
  - **Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)**: End with prompts like “Like if you agree!” or “Comment your version!”.
  - **Trend Integration**: Use trending hashtags (e.g., #LifeHacks) or audio to boost discoverability.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - **Challenges**: Create or join viral challenges (e.g., #BrandChallenge) to encourage user-generated content.
  - **Polls/Questions**: Add text overlays like “Which is better?” to spark comments.
  - **Duet/Stitch Features**: Encourage users to respond via Douyin’s duet or stitch tools.
    - Example: A fashion brand invites users to duet their outfit transition video.
- **Community Management**:
  - Reply to comments within 1 hour to boost algorithm weight (Douyin prioritizes active creators).
  - Pin top comments to highlight engagement and encourage more.
  - Example: A brand replies to user comments on a skincare video, increasing comment rate by 25%.
- **Platform-Specific Tips**:
  - **Music**: 70% of viral Douyin videos use trending audio tracks.
  - **Length**: 15-30 seconds optimal for high complete view rates (>70%).
  - **Visuals**: High clarity (1080p), dynamic transitions, and AR effects (e.g., filters) boost engagement.
- **Teaching Activity**:
  - Students redesign a 15-second video to include a 3-second hook, trending music, and a CTA, then simulate posting to a test account.

#### (4) Data-Driven Interaction Optimization (1 Hour)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Complete View Rate**: Target >70% to enter larger traffic pools.
  - **Engagement Rate**: Likes + comments + shares ÷ views; aim for >5%.
  - **Comment-to-View Ratio**: High-comment videos (e.g., >1%) get algorithmic boosts.
  - **Share Rate**: Viral videos achieve 0.5-1% share rates.
